# What is Universal turing machine ?
A UTM is a theoretical model of computation that can simulate the behavior of any other Turing machine, like a Computer.

![UTM](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/121222311/6975ae80-4bfd-4bbf-bafc-a2b163aaaa7d)

As you see in picture above, UTM has three tapes which are as follows:
1.Description tape: Used for the rules the turing machine has.
2.Input tape: Involve the input of turing machine.
3.State tape: Show which state the turing machine is currently ar\t.

# Classes
There are 4 important classes which are as follows:

### Turing machine (TM)
This is a simple turing machine. You can construct a turing machine by giving an array of string with standard format.

#### Standard input format
Standard format : 
states:{(States like qn that n represent state number)}

start_state:{[starting state]}

final_states:{[final states]}

actions:{[transaction rules like (qi,1,x,R,q0)]}

For exmaple this is a turing machine for adding 2 numbers with standard format:

states:{q0,q1,q2,q3}

start_state:{q0}

final_states:{q3}

actions:{(q0,1,blank,R,q1),(q1,1,1,R,q1),(q1,#,1,R,q2),(q2,1,1,L,q2),(q2,blank,blank,R,q3)}

Or this is an exmaple of multiplication with standard format:

states:{q5,q6,q0,q1,q10,q11,q2,q9,q3,q8,q7,q4}

start_state:{q5}

final_states:{q11}

actions:{(q5,1,1,L,q6),(q6,blank,#,R,q0),(q0,1,1,R,q0),(q0,#,#,R,q1),(q1,x,x,R,q1),(q1,1,x,L,q2),(q1,blank,blank,L,q10),(q10,1,1,L,q10),(q10,#,#,L,q10),(q10,x,1,L,q10),(q10,blank,blank,R,q11),(q2,x,x,L,q2),(q2,#,#,L,q3),(q3,y,y,L,q3),(q3,#,#,R,q9),(q3,1,y,L,q4)(q9,y,1,R,q9),(q9,#,#,R,q1),(q4,1,1,L,q4),(q4,#,#,L,q7),(q7,1,1,L,q7),(q7,blank,1,R,q8),(q8,#,#,R,q8),(q8,1,1,R,q8),(q8,y,y,L,q3)}

### Binary Turing machine (BTM)
This turing machine do everythings with 0 and 1's. Note that universal turing machine can run only BTM.

BTM will convert everything to 0 and 1.
we will cover more detail about impelemntions later.

### InputTape
As you know a turing machine need infinite tape. To implement this we made a tape that increased in size if necessary.

### Universal turing machine
Universal turing machine get the 3 tape mentioned above and start to simulate the given arbitrary turing machine. Finally the result is shown on the input tape with the messages like acceptance or rejection of desired languages.

# Implementation details
## TM
### Class attributes
![Attr](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/121222311/f28090b8-ac87-4978-899d-250379a57374)

As you can see in the picture it has array of string for rules that save transition rules with this format : 
qi a b L/R qj that are seprated with space.(i and j are number. a and b are alphabets)
Also save all states in an array of string.
Save start and end states in string.
Save the alphabets of machine in a Arraylist.

### TM constructor 

![Tm](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/121222311/f274ca2e-980d-4843-b351-dde7e5d37a19)

This function uses regex to find information in standard input and also saves them in class attributes.
If we have more than 1 final states in our machine it will call a function to convert them all to just one final state and return the new rules for Tm.
It also will raise an exception if machine has more than 1 initial state.

### TMtoBTM

![TMtoBTM](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/121222311/14d1ff36-5ab6-41a6-bb97-5c3205efa4b8)

This method will return a BTM that we will cover next. It will change attributs to 0 and 1's.
This method will use attributes in TM to construct a BTM.
The blank will be 1
Start state will be 1
Final state will be 11
L : 1
R : 11
The transition rules will be like this 10101011011.

### Print
It is a simple method to print attributes of class. Nothing fancy!!!!

### SingeFinal

![Screenshot 2024-07-04 000213](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/135022735/2d3aff01-9126-4316-9565-96b32acf46eb)

As mentioned in TM constructor section, if turing machine has more than 1 final state this method is called to convert all these states to one just for the simplification of operation.

## BTM
### Class attributes

![BTM](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/121222311/2069cea7-f5db-46f5-a38b-9f1da44afec5)
This class contains a Hashtabe to hash input tapes to 1's , and also has a rules String that contains 0 and 1's

### Constructor
Nothing fancy you can just read it.

### convert

![convert](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/121222311/614cda6e-481a-4c04-b5d3-c39d67113f6e)

This method will get a String[] as input and will convert it to 1's based on hashtable and will return a new tape.

## Input Tape
### Class attributes
A String array that every string shows a symbol of alphabet (it has better time complexity than array of char because when you want to put a
new elemet that length is more or less than last one you should shift elements , but here its not necessery)
### Replace

![Replace](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/121222311/9aa56c3a-00a4-4d69-8ec4-dc71c15714cc)

In replace method it will replace element i with another string that is given. It is like when you want write b on tape. 
If elemnt i was out of bound it will increase the tape size 3 times. 
Ù‘or example if tape was blank,x,blank => blank,blank,blank,blank,x,blank,blank,blank,blank 
This will be done if and only if we want to write somewhere on tape where is out of bound.
Also it will return new head because as you see in the example x was in index 1 but after resizing it is in position 4.

## UTM
### Attributes and constructor

![Screenshot 2024-07-04 001934](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/135022735/4d5efafb-14ff-4764-9359-5fed7168fa15)

For UTM class we need 3 tapes which we discussed before. All attributes initialize with nulll.

### Run

![Screenshot 2024-07-04 002302](https://github.com/AliRje82/Theory-UTM/assets/135022735/8690f46c-aa85-4044-a827-4d37d5b9c00a)

This method get a BTM and its input and start to simulate the turing machine encoded to 1's and 0's. The result will be shown on input tape.
If there is no transition rule for the state, the UTM will hault. If it haults on final state, a message will be appeared with a acceptence of languaged otherwise the language will be rejected. For this method, we also use findRule method. This method find the appropriate rule for the given input and state among all the transition rules.
